## Introduction
During the "Development of Software Systems" course, we, Domen Laznik, Nejc Petkoski, and Nik Damiš, were tasked with developing a video game as a group project. Our group name is "Group 7". The game is a battle game where players can choose characters and arenas to fight in.

## Task 2: Creating Groups and Ideas

### Concept
Our initial challenge was to set up the development environment. We decided to create a two-player battle game where players can fight against each other using different characters and arenas.

### Tools Used
- **Communication Tool:** Discord
- **Development Environment:** PyCharm (using PyGame library)
- **Code Sharing:** GitHub
- **Task Management:** Jira

## Task 3: Project Start

### Detailed Idea Presentation
The game is set in a medieval time where samurais and knights prevail. The game features three characters, each with unique abilities and stories. The goal is to defeat the opponent by reducing their health to zero.

### Character and Arena Creation
Each team member created their character and arena, focusing on maintaining a consistent style and size.

### Programming
We started programming using Python and the PyGame library, implementing basic functionalities such as character movement and platform interaction.

## Task 4: Game Development

### Communication
We used Discord for regular communication, sharing progress and discussing implementations.

### Code Sharing
We used GitHub for code sharing, ensuring that everyone had access to the latest version of the project.

### Project Tracking
We used Jira for task management, creating and tracking tasks to ensure organized progress.

## Task 5: Prototype Implementation

### Changes and Implementation
We restructured our code to improve readability and organization, creating separate classes for characters, weapons, and arenas.

### Weapon Implementation
We implemented different types of weapons, ensuring they have unique attributes and functionalities.

### Arena Implementation
We added various arenas with different gravitational values and platforms to enhance gameplay diversity.

## Task 6: Beta Version

### Visual Improvements
We improved the game's visual aspects, adding shadows, borders, and health bars to enhance character visibility and aesthetics.

### Health System
Implemented a health system with adjustable health bars for each character.

### Upcoming Tasks
- Custom animations for all characters
- Further visual and gameplay enhancements

## Conclusion
Our project has progressed significantly, transitioning from an initial idea to a functional prototype. We have implemented core gameplay mechanics, developed unique characters and arenas, and made visual improvements. We look forward to refining the game further and adding new features.
